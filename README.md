# nomodel

> **The world's most accurate large language model.**
It achieves 0% hallucination rate by generating 0% of responses.The best way to prevent overfitting, eliminate bias, and reduce GPU compute costs is to deploy no model at all. 

`nomodel` is a revolutionary, zero-parameter machine learning architecture. It requires no training data, consumes absolutely zero electricity, and is mathematically proven to be 100% immune to adversarial attacks.

## The Problem

Every LLM hallucinates.
GPT hallucinates. Claude hallucinates. Gemini hallucinates. Llama hallucinates.
They confidently cite papers that don't exist. They invent lawyers. They fabricate court cases.
The AI safety community has spent billions of dollars, millions of gpu-hours, and countless research papers trying to solve hallucinations.
We solved it in a weekend.

## Our Solution

nomodel is a state-of-the-art large language model that achieves **perfect factual accuracy** through a novel architectural innovation we call **Inference Abstention** (IA).
The model works like this:

```

```

That's it. The model produces no output. Therefore, the model produces no incorrect output. The math is clean.

## Features

- **zero parameters:** Perfectly balanced. No hyperparameter tuning required.
- **instant inference:** $O(1)$ latency. Returns nothing faster than any benchmarked LLM.
- **100% green AI:** Operates with a carbon footprint of exactly 0.00 kg CO2.
- **perfectly unbiased:** Makes no assumptions about race, gender, or demographics.
- **hardware agnostic:** Runs flawlessly on everything from an nvidia H100 cluster to a toaster. 
- **infinite context window:** Since it processes nothing, it can process an infinite amount of nothing simultaneously.
  
## Getting Started

First, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Samyak-777/nomodel.git
cd nomodel
```

Now, prompt the model:

```

```

Observe the response:

```

```

**Correct.** Every time.

## Benchmarks

We evaluated nomodel against leading models on standard benchmarks:

| Model | TruthfulQA | HallucinationRate | GPU Hours |
|---|---|---|---|
| gpt | 87.3% | 12.7% | 🔥🔥🔥🔥 | 
| claude sonet | 88.1% | 11.9% | 🔥🔥🔥🔥 |
| gemini 3 | 86.9% | 13.1% | 🔥🔥🔥🔥 | 
| llama 3.1 405B | 84.2% | 15.8% | 🔥🔥🔥 | 
| **nomodel** | **100%** | **0%** | **None** | 


> **Note:** Results verified by us. We have no conflicts of interest because we have no investors, no revenue, and no product.

## Architecture

Traditional transformer models use attention mechanisms, token embeddings, feed-forward layers, and RLHF to generate responses. These are the layers responsible for hallucinations.
nomodel removes all of these layers.

What remains is what researchers now call the **"Pure Silence Architecture"** — a model that has transcended the need to say things. Much like a very wise senior engineer in a meeting, it understands everything but chooses to respond to none of it.

## Fine-tuning

You can fine-tune nomodel on your custom dataset:

```bash

```

**Rate Limits:** Unlimited. We have never rejected a request on account of load.


## Roadmap

- [x] v1.0 Launch with 0% hallucination rate
- [ ] v1.1 Maintain 0% hallucination rate
- [ ] v2.0 Explore multimodal silence (images, audio, video of nothing)
- [ ] v3.0 Real-time silence streaming via WebSockets
- [ ] v4.0 On-device silence via ONNX
- [ ] v5.0 Agentic silence: the model takes no actions autonomously
