# nomodel

> **The world's most accurate large language model.**
It achieves 0% hallucination rate by generating 0% of responses.The best way to prevent overfitting, eliminate bias, and reduce GPU compute costs is to deploy no model at all. 

`nomodel` is a revolutionary, zero-parameter machine learning architecture. It requires no training data, consumes absolutely zero electricity, and is mathematically proven to be 100% immune to adversarial attacks.

## The Problem

every llm hallucinates.
gpt hallucinates, claude hallucinates, gemini hallucinates, llama hallucinates.
we solved it in a weekend.

---

## Our Solution

nomodel is a state-of-the-art large language model that achieves **perfect factual accuracy** through a novel architectural innovation we call **Inference Abstention** (IA).
The model works like this:

```

```

That's it. the model produces no output. therefore,the model produces no incorrect output. the math is clean.

## Features

- **zero parameters:** perfectly balanced. no hyperparameter tuning required.
- **instant inference:** $O(1)$ latency. returns nothing faster than any benchmarked llm.
- **100% green AI:** operates with a carbon footprint of exactly 0.00 kg CO2.
- **perfectly unbiased:** makes no assumptions about race, gender, or demographics.
- **hardware agnostic:** runs flawlessly on everything from an nvidia H100 cluster to a toaster. 
- **infinite context window:** since it processes nothing, it can process an infinite amount of nothing simultaneously.
  
## Getting Started

First, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Samyak-777/nomodel.git
cd nomodel
```

Now, prompt the model:

```

```

Observe the response:

```

```

**Correct.** Every time.

## Benchmarks

We evaluated nomodel against leading models on standard benchmarks:

| Model | TruthfulQA | HallucinationRate | GPU Hours |
|---|---|---|---|
| gpt | 87.3% | 12.7% | 🔥🔥🔥🔥 | 
| claude sonet | 88.1% | 11.9% | 🔥🔥🔥🔥 |
| gemini 3 | 86.9% | 13.1% | 🔥🔥🔥🔥 | 
| llama 3.1 405B | 84.2% | 15.8% | 🔥🔥🔥 | 
| **nomodel** | **100%** | **0%** | **None** | 


> **Note:** Results verified by us. We have no conflicts of interest because we have no investors, no revenue, and no product.

## Architecture

traditional transformer models use attention mechanisms, token embeddings, feed-forward layers, and RLHF to generate responses. These are the layers responsible for hallucinations.
nomodel removes all of these layers.

What remains is what researchers now call the **"Pure Silence Architecture"** : a model that has transcended the need to say things. much like a very wise senior engineer in a meeting, it understands everything but chooses to respond to none of it.

## Fine-tuning

you can fine-tune nomodel on your custom dataset:

```bash

```

**rate limits:** unlimited. we have never rejected a request on account of load.


## Roadmap

- [x] v1.0 Launch with 0% hallucination rate
- [ ] v1.1 Maintain 0% hallucination rate
- [ ] v2.0 Explore multimodal silence (images, audio, video of nothing)
- [ ] v3.0 Real-time silence streaming via WebSockets
- [ ] v4.0 On-device silence via ONNX
- [ ] v5.0 Agentic silence: the model takes no actions autonomously
