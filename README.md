# nomodel

> **The world's most accurate large language model.**
It achieves 0% hallucination rate by generating 0% of responses.The best way to prevent overfitting, eliminate bias, and reduce GPU compute costs is to deploy no model at all. 

`nomodel` is a revolutionary, zero-parameter machine learning architecture. It requires no training data, consumes absolutely zero electricity, and is mathematically proven to be 100% immune to adversarial attacks.

## The Problem

Every LLM hallucinates.
GPT hallucinates. Claude hallucinates. Gemini hallucinates. Llama hallucinates.
They confidently cite papers that don't exist. They invent lawyers. They fabricate court cases. They tell you `Array.prototype.flapjack()` is a real JavaScript method. They explain that Napoleon was 5'2" (he was 5'7"). They write your grandmother's "secret cookie recipe" — which, coincidentally, involves brake fluid.
The AI safety community has spent billions of dollars, millions of GPU-hours, and countless research papers trying to solve hallucinations.
We solved it in a weekend.

## Our Solution

nomodel is a state-of-the-art large language model that achieves **perfect factual accuracy** through a novel architectural innovation we call **Inference Abstention** (IA).
The model works like this:

```

```

That's it. The model produces no output. Therefore, the model produces no incorrect output. The math is clean.

## Getting Started

First, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Samyak-777/nomodel.git
cd nomodel
```

Now, prompt the model:

```

```

Observe the response:

```

```

**Correct.** Every time.

## Benchmarks

We evaluated nomodel against leading models on standard benchmarks:

| Model | TruthfulQA | HallucinationRate | GPU Hours | Parameters |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GPT-4o | 87.3% | 12.7% | 🔥🔥🔥🔥 | 1.8T (est.) |
| Claude Opus | 88.1% | 11.9% | 🔥🔥🔥🔥 | Unknown |
| Gemini Ultra | 86.9% | 13.1% | 🔥🔥🔥🔥 | Unknown |
| Llama 3.1 405B | 84.2% | 15.8% | 🔥🔥🔥 | 405B |
| **nomodel** | **100%** | **0%** | **None** | **0** |


> **Note:** Results verified by us. We have no conflicts of interest because we have no investors, no revenue, and no product.

## Architecture

Traditional transformer models use attention mechanisms, token embeddings, feed-forward layers, and RLHF to generate responses. These are the layers responsible for hallucinations.
nomodel removes all of these layers.

What remains is what researchers now call the **"Pure Silence Architecture"** — a model that has transcended the need to say things. Much like a very wise senior engineer in a meeting, it understands everything but chooses to respond to none of it.

## Deployment

Deploy nomodel to production:

```bash

```

Scale to handle 10 million requests per second:

```bash

```

Monitor your deployment:

```bash

```

Your infrastructure costs are now $0/month. Your model is always up. It has never had a service disruption. We achieve 100% uptime because there is no service to disrupt.

---

## Fine-tuning

You can fine-tune nomodel on your custom dataset:

```bash

```

**Rate Limits:** Unlimited. We have never rejected a request on account of load.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: But it doesn't actually answer anything.**
A: Define "answer."

**Q: This is useless.**
A: Is it? Think about the last time an AI confidently gave you wrong information and you trusted it. Who's useless now?

**Q: How does this compare to just... doing nothing?**
A: We have a Dockerfile.

**Q: Is this a joke?**
A: Every other LLM has a 5–20% hallucination rate. We have 0%. We're the only ones not joking.

**Q: What about RAG? Grounding? Chain-of-thought?**
A: Those are all valiant attempts to fix a problem we avoided entirely.

**Q: I submitted a PR adding code. Why was it rejected?**
A: You're not getting it.

## Roadmap

- [x] v1.0 — Launch with 0% hallucination rate
- [ ] v1.1 — Maintain 0% hallucination rate
- [ ] v2.0 — Explore multimodal silence (images, audio, video of nothing)
- [ ] v3.0 — Real-time silence streaming via WebSockets
- [ ] v4.0 — On-device silence via ONNX
- [ ] v5.0 — Agentic silence — the model takes no actions autonomously

## Features

- **Zero Parameters:** Perfectly balanced. No hyperparameter tuning required.
- **Instant Inference:** $O(1)$ latency. Returns nothing faster than any benchmarked LLM.
- **100% Green AI:** Operates with a carbon footprint of exactly 0.00 kg CO2.
- **Perfectly Unbiased:** Makes no assumptions about race, gender, or demographics.
- **Hardware Agnostic:** Runs flawlessly on everything from an NVIDIA H100 cluster to a toaster. 
- **Infinite Context Window:** Since it processes nothing, it can process an infinite amount of nothing simultaneously.
